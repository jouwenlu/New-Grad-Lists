                            This guide covers the basics and contains questions that banks most frequently ask. The WSO guide also offers actual past interview questions and is especially helpful for S&T or capital markets interviews (stocks, bonds, loans, interest rates, currencies, options, and derivatives).

                            The M&I guide is a mandatory resource that helps prepare candidates for technical interviews. It can be more in depth (in the “Advanced” sections) than the WSO guide, but we still recommend that you read this to be as prepared as possible because we find that candidates sometimes hear these questions verbatim.

                            This guide gives you the gold standard for how to answer behavioral interview questions, as well as strategies for structuring your responses. Behavioral interviews are the most important segment of the process because most candidates answer technical questions correctly and pass the bar, so reading this guide gives you the opportunity to differentiate yourself.

                            Last but not least, the networking guide is especially important for folks who do not have on campus recruitment at their universities. It gives you a list of questions to ask so that you can always be prepared for professional conversations. Some other information here include LinkedIn strategies, cover letter formatting, and business etiquette.
